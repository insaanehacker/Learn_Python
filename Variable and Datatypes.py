# A variable is a container which is used to store data values, It can store anything

# Sample program without variable
print("My name is dolby")
print("My age is 20")
print("I live in Florida")
# The above program prints only the contents, but what we need to change the name and age in the above program
# It is possible to replace each instance with our own name and age, but imagine you have coded thousands of line and you want to change the name and age now
# Here comes our variable to fix these issue

# update the name and age using variable to our previous program
my_name = "insaane" # Here we are assigning a variable named my_name to store a value,I have instructed to store insaane
my_age = "22" # Here we are assigning a variable named my_age to store a value , here i have instructed to store 22
print("My name is " + my_name)  # Instead of name, I have instructed to get the value from the variable:my_name
print("My age is " + my_age)  # Instead of name, I have instructed to get the value from the variable:my_age
print("I live in Florida")

# A variable can store any datatype.....
# A variable can store string, integer, float, boolean

# Example of string datatype...using variable
string_data = "I love Florida"
print(string_data)

# Example of integer datatype...using variable
integer_data = 20  # Integers are numbers, float
print(integer_data)
# Example of float datatype...using variable
float_data = 12.65565676756
print(float_data)
# Example of boolean datatype...using variable
boolean_data = True
# This is used to check the statement is true or false
boolean_data = False
