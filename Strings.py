# string can be anything...it can be name,place or anything
# In order to represent a string we use........""......these quotation marks

# 1st Example
print("Insaane") # Here i have given Insaane inside the quotation marks.....This will print output as Insaane

# Lets use variable to print our strings
my_name = "data" # Here i have given "data" inside the quotation marks.....This will print output as data
print(my_name) # Here we call our variable using print function, we get output as data

# To print a new line.......we use \n in python
print("\n")

# We can use functions to assign our data as we like
my_name = "Tajmahal" # Here i have assigned a string "Tajmahal" and assigned it to my_name variable
print(my_name.lower()) # lower() is a function which is used to low case your character
print(my_name.upper()) # upper() is a function which is used to up case your character
print(len(my_name)) # len() is a function to check the length in our string

# Index
# In python....Index starts with 0
print(my_name[0]) # 0 index is T, So T will be printed out

my_name = "Tajmahal"
       #   01234567   ..................see the index

# We can call able to find the index of a string using index function in python
print(my_name.index("m")) # "m" is in index 3 so 3 will be printed

# we can replace a string with other using replace function in python
print(my_name.replace("Tajmahal", "Don")) # Now the "Tajmahal" will be replaced by "Don"

# There are more functions dealing with strings, I have told you most used functions...You can google for more functions
