# Python can deal with numbers very well
print(2) # we are instructing python to print number 2
print(-2) # we can print negative number too in python

# Python can do bunch of mathematical and complex calculations too,
print(5 + 2) # This will add 5 and 2
print(5 - 2) # This will subract 5 and 2
print(3 * 4) # This will mulplies 3 and 4
print(10 / 2) # This will divide 10 by 2

# Python can do complex operations too
print(10 % 3) # It means we are telling python to print out the remainder
# 10 % 3 is 1........So it prints output as 1

print(abs(-7)) # "abs" means absolute value.....it will convert negative number to positive number
# -7 will be converted to 7.....so it prints output as 7

print(max(7, 10)) # "max" compares which number is greater....Here 10 is greater so we get output as 10
print(min(7, 10)) # "min" compares which number is smaller....Here 7 is smaller so we get output as 7

print(round(3.4))
# This will round off the number, so we get output as 3
print(round(3.7)) # Here we get output as 4

# In python we can use many functions, but inorder to use them we need to import math library
# Lets import math library
from math import *   # This will import mathematical functions to our program

print(pow(3, 3)) # "pow" is used to find the power of a value....Here 3^3 is 27...so we get output as 27
print(sqrt(36)) # "Sqrt" is used to print the square root of a number...Here square root of 36 is 6
print(floor(3.4)) # "floor" avoids the decimal value....so we get output as 3
print(ceil(5.3)) # "ceil" rounds off decimal value....so we get output as 6, Means whatever decimal value is present, it will round off the number

# In addition to this we have more, google and find out more...
# I have thought you some of the most common ones used in industry
