# Here we are going to get input from user
# sometimes you need to enter your data or value to the console....In order to achieve your private things.....
# To tell that in a simple manner, It is not possible to change name again and again after coding a web or any interface
# So here comes our input....to solve the problem

# To get input from user, you need to use input() .......and inside brackets you many specify anything in form of string

# Example
input("What is your name? :") # This will prompt in console, So you should enter your name, This is an idea

# Now lets assign a variable and will get input from user
my_name = input("Hello, What is your name buddy :")
print("My name is " + my_name + "!")

# Similarly we can get the age or any data we want
my_name = input("Hello, What is your name buddy :")
my_age = input("What is your age :")
print("My name is " + my_name + ", I am " + my_age + " years old")
